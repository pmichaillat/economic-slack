### Economic Slack: Fall 2025 Syllabus

---

#### Course description

The course covers research topics related to economic slack, which comprises productive resources that are unused and production that is unsold. The course is centered around formal modeling, but it also presents some of the evidence supporting the assumptions introduced in the models. The course presents models of economic slack and discusses policies used to tackle slack. The course tries to answer several questions: 

+ Why does slack exist?
+ How does slack affect economic life?
+ Why does slack vary over time? 
+ How are slack fluctuations related to price and wage rigidity?
+ What is the socially optimal level of slack?
+ How should monetary policy respond to fluctuations in slack over the business cycle?
+ How should fiscal policy respond to fluctuations in slack over the business cycle?

#### Switching to research mode

You should be shifting away from learning the results of other people's research into learning how to conduct your own research. A major reason for teaching this material is to positively influence your research. We will also devote a good part of the course to active research. We will practice:

+ How to select a research question
+ How to position your paper in the literature
+ How to develop and refine the answer to your research question

By the end of the course, you will have experienced all the stages of a research project and completed a short research paper.

The main readings cover important material on which the lectures are based. You should read them from beginning to end, reproduce the key steps of the derivations, and remember the key results. Additional readings are also be provided: they give additional theoretical results, empirical evidence, background, and may be useful for your research project.

---

#### Presentation of readings

Most Tuesday class meetings will be devoted to discussing readings. 

To lead the discussion, students will give 10-minute presentations that summarize the readings for the week. Each student will give several presentations during the quarter (the exact number of presentations will depend on the enrollment). The presentations will be [scheduled in advance](https://github.com/pmichaillat/economic-slack/blob/main/schedule.md).

Each presentation should have 6 slides addressing the following questions:

1. Context - How does the paper relate to the lecture material? How does it contribute to the course material?
2. Question - What is the research question addressed by the paper?
3. Answer - What are the main elements of the answer to the research question?
4. Illustration - Illustrate graphically the answer to the research question or an interesting mechanism discussed in the paper.
5. Positioning - How does the paper contribute to the previous  literature?
6. Conclusion - What are the limitations of the answer provided in the paper? How could the answer be improved? What else would you have liked to know or learn on the topic?

If you need a few more slides to explain the paper and its results, or if you need not just one but a few graphs to explain the mechanisms, that is no problem at all as long as the presentation remains below 10 minutes.

Presentation slides must be [written in LaTeX](#latex-resources) and compiled to a PDF. Presentation slides should be [uploaded into your GitHub repository](https://github.com/pmichaillat/economic-slack/blob/main/github.md) before noon on the day of the presentation.

#### Research paper

Thursday class meetings will be devoted to research. Indeed, this is a research-intensive course, which will serve as good preparation for conducing research in macroeconomics.  One of the main objectives of the course is that every student produces a short research paper on a topic related to economic slack.

#### Objective of the paper

A good research paper should do the following:

1. Develop a well-posed, original research question
2. Answer the research question using a combination of theory, numerical simulations, and empirical analysis
3. Position the paper in the prior literature

Your research paper will be evaluated based on how well it accomplishes these three tasks. More specifically, a good research paper should adhere to the following guidelines:

1. It should describe its research question, and explain why it is an original and interesting question.
2. It should review the prior literature to explain how the paper advances that literature.
3. It should describe the model, data, empirical strategy, and computational method used to answer the questions. 
4. It should describe the results obtained in the analysis using diagrams, tables, and figures.
5. It should discuss the implications of the analysis, and explain how its limitations could be addressed in the future.

You should work on your research project on your own. However, you should feel free to discuss methods and literature with your peers and elicit their feedback. To get you started, [possible ideas for the research project](https://github.com/pmichaillat/economic-slack/blob/main/ideas.md) are presented in the course portal.

#### Due dates

+ Thursday 16 October: presentation of project outline in class

#### Structure of the research paper

The structure of your paper should support your argument. It should help convince the reader that you have answered your research question in a compelling way. 

Your research paper should be short and adhere to the following guidelines:

+ Papers must be less than 6,000 words. The wordcount excludes the reference list.
+ Papers should contain no more than 5 exhibits (tables and figures). Individual exhibits are limited to one page each.
+ Papers must include an abstract of 150 or fewer words.
+ Papers must be self-contained. A reader should be able follow the analysis in the paper and be convinced it is correct and coherent from the main text alone, without consulting any appendix. 

The research paper must be [written in LaTeX](#latex-resources) and compiled to a PDF. The paper should be [uploaded into your GitHub repository](https://github.com/pmichaillat/economic-slack/blob/main/github.md) before noon on the due date.

#### Code and data

Any code and data used in the analysis must be submitted with the paper. This applies both to code used to simulate models and to code used to analyse data. Code and data should be [uploaded into your GitHub repository](https://github.com/pmichaillat/economic-slack/blob/main/github.md) at the same time as your research paper.

The code should be commented so that a reader can understand how to code works. The code should also work out of the box, so that the entire analysis can be reproduced with one prompt. Please include a README file describing all files and explaining how to run the code and obtain the results. Please use the [following code and data repository](https://github.com/pmichaillat/feru) as a template.

#### Writing resources

Several books might be helpful to write your research paper. First, a good research paper must have a good structure. A good reference on how to structure your paper is [*The Little Book of Research Writing*](https://www.amazon.com/Little-Book-Research-Writing/dp/1974673162) by V. Chaubey.

Scientific papers involve an elements that does not appear in other writings but are fundamental to communicate scientific ideas: graphs. It is important to make clear, clean, and meaningful graphs. A great reference on how to create compelling graphs is [*The Visual Display of Quantitative Information*](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_vdqi) by E.R. Tufte.

Once your paper has a good structure and good graphs, a decent writing style helps readers navigate the paper. The canonical reference on English style is [*The Elements of Style*](https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Style-4th-William-Strunk/dp/0205313426) by W. Strunk and E. B. White.

Whatever you write, it is important to follow the rules and conventions of the English language. The canonical manual is the [*Chicago Manual of Style*](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/home.html). You should consult it if you have any question about English writing, rules, and conventions.

#### LaTeX resources

LaTeX is the best system to typeset scientific research: it allows to typeset mathematical expressions, insert tables and figures with results, and manage references. This is why you are asked to write your slides and paper in LaTeX. If you continue on a research path, you will need to use LaTeX, so it is good to learn how to use it now. LaTeX templates are available on GitHub to get you started:

+ [LaTeX template for research paper](https://github.com/pmichaillat/latex-paper)
+ [LaTeX template for academic presentations](https://github.com/pmichaillat/latex-presentation)

If you are new to LaTeX, [use Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/edu/ucsantacruz), for which UCSC supplies professional accounts. Overleaf makes it easy to produce papers and presentations in LaTeX directly from your web browser. You can use the above templates with Overleaf.

#### Generative artificial intelligence (AI)

In this course, a primary objective is for you to develop the critical thinking, research, and writing skills essential for your academic and professional career. To ensure you are the sole author of your work, the use of generative AI tools—such as ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot, and Claude—for generating any portion of your submitted assignments is strictly prohibited. This includes using AI to brainstorm, create outlines, write drafts, summarize articles, or rephrase text. You are, of course, welcome to use standard tools that check grammar and spelling on text you have already written yourself.

Our goal in this class is to work on our research and writing skills together. We ask that all submitted work is your own original creation from start to finish to make sure you get the most out of every assignment. Relying on AI to generate your text short-circuits this critical practice.
