### Economic Slack: Fall 2025 Syllabus

---

#### Course description

The course covers research topics related to economic slack, which comprises productive resources that are unused and production that is unsold. The course is centered around formal modeling, but it also presents some of the evidence supporting the assumptions introduced in the models. The course presents models of economic slack and discusses policies used to tackle slack. The course tries to answer several questions: 

+ Why does slack exist?
+ How does slack affect economic life?
+ Why does slack vary over time? 
+ How are slack fluctuations related to price and wage rigidity?
+ What is the socially optimal level of slack?
+ How should monetary policy respond to fluctuations in slack over the business cycle?
+ How should fiscal policy respond to fluctuations in slack over the business cycle?

#### Switching to research mode

You should be shifting away from learning the results of other people's research into learning how to conduct your own research. A major reason for teaching this material is to positively influence your research. We will also devote a good part of the course to active research. We will practice:

+ How to select a research question
+ How to position your paper in the literature
+ How to develop and refine the answer to your research question

By the end of the course, you will have experienced all the stages of a research project and completed a short research paper.

Additional readings are also be provided in each section. These readings provide additional theoretical results, empirical evidence, some background, and may provide inspiration for your research.

---

#### Presentation of readings

On Tuesdays, students will give 10-minute presentations that summarize the readings for the week. Each presentation should have 5 slides addressing the following questions:

1. What is the research question addressed by the paper?
2. How does the material covered in the paper contribute to the previous literature? Which gap does it fill?
3. What are the main elements of the answer to the research question?
4. Illustrate graphically the answer to the research question or an interesting mechanism discussed in the paper.
5. What are the limitations of the answer provided in the paper? How could the answer be improved?

If you need a few more slides to explain the paper and its results, or if you need not just one but a few graphs to explain the mechanisms, that is no problem at all as long as the presentation remains below 10 minutes.

Presentation slides must be written in LaTeX and compiled to a PDF. 

The slides should be uploaded to the course portal before the presentation. The easiest way to upload your slides is through [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). After forking the course repository, add your slides to the folder `presentations` in your fork, and then submit a pull request. Once your pull request is accepted, your branch will be merged to the course repository, thereby adding your slides to the course folder. Please adhere to the following naming convention for the presentation: `AuthorsYear.pdf`.

#### Research paper

One of the main objectives of the course is that every student produces a short research paper on a topic related to economic slack.

##### Objective of the paper

A good research paper should do the following:

+ Develop a well-posed research question
+ Answer the research question using a combination of theory, numerical simulations, and empirical analysis
+ Position the paper in the prior literature

##### Due dates

+ Thursday 16 October: presentation of project outline in class
+ Thursday 13 November: presentation of early results in class
+ Thursday 4 December: presentation of final results in class
+ Thursday 11 December at noon: submission final paper by email

##### Format of the research presentations

###### Project outline

The project outline should be presented in 10 minutes with 4–7 slides.

+ Slide 1: research question—what are you asking in the project and why that matters
+ Slide 2: positioning—what we already know and what we do not yet know
+ Slide 3: research methodology—how you will address the research question
+ Slides 4–6: overview of what you have so far—data and model and code
+ Slide 7: hurdles and next steps
+ It is fine to propose several possible projects.

###### Early results

Early results should be presented in 10–15 minutes with 7–10 slides.

+ Slide 1: review the research question and why it matters
+ Slide 2: position of the project in the literature—explain what the few most related papers have done and not done, and how your paper is going to fill this gap
+ Slide 3: review the research method: how you will answer the research question
+ Slides 4–6: overview of the data, model, and method
+ Slides 7–9: overview of the early results
+ Slide 10: current roadblocks and next steps

###### Final results

Final results should be presented in 15 minutes with 7–10 slides.

+ Slide 1: review the research question and why it matters
+ Slide 2: position of the project in the literature
+ Slides 3–5: overview of the data, model, and methodology
+ Slides 6–9: description of the final results
+ Slide 10: summary and implications

###### Submission of research presentations

All research presentations should be written in LaTeX, compiled to a PDF, and [submitted by email](mailto:pamichai@ucsc.edu) at least one hour before class.

##### Format of the paper

Your research paper should be short and adhere to the following guidelines:

+ Papers must be less than 6,000 words. The wordcount excludes the reference list.
+ Papers should contain no more than 5 exhibits (tables and figures). Individual exhibits are limited to one page each.
+ Papers must include an abstract of 150 or fewer words.
+ Papers must be self-contained. Specifically, a reader should be able to follow the analysis in the paper and be convinced it is correct and coherent from the main text alone, without consulting the appendix. For empirical work, the main text should include relevant information about data sources, variable definitions and construction, the estimating equations, and any other information needed to understand and assess each exhibit in the main text. For theoretical work, proofs should be contained in the paper.

The research paper should be written in LaTeX, compiled to a PDF, and [submitted by email](mailto:pamichai@ucsc.edu) before the due date.

#### Writing resources

There is no textbook for this course, but several books might be helpful to write your research paper.

First and foremost, a good research paper needs to have a good structure. A good reference on how to structure your paper is [The Little Book of Research Writing](https://www.amazon.com/Little-Book-Research-Writing/dp/1974673162) by V. Chaubey.

Scientific papers involve an elements that does not appear in other writings but is fundamental to communicate scientific ideas: graphs. It is important to make clear, clean, and meaningful graphs. A great reference on how to create compelling graphs is [The Visual Display of Quantitative Information](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_vdqi) by E.R. Tufte.

Once your paper has a good structure and good graphs,  a decent style helps readers navigate the paper. The canonical reference on English style is [The Elements of Style](https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Style-4th-William-Strunk/dp/0205313426) by W. Strunk and E. B. White.

Whatever you write, it is important to follow the rules and conventions of the English language. The canonical manual—followed by most US journals—is the [Chicago Manual of Style](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/home.html). You should consult it if you have any question about English writing, rules, conventions, and style.

#### LaTeX resources

LaTeX is the best system to typeset scientific research. In particular, it allows to typeset mathematical expressions, insert tables and figures with results, and manage scientific references. This is why you are asked to write your presentation slides and research paper in LaTeX. If you continue on a research path, you will need to use LaTeX, so it is good to learn how to use it now.

LaTeX templates are available on GitHub to help you write your presentations and research paper:

+ [LaTeX template for research paper](https://github.com/pmichaillat/latex-paper)
+ [LaTeX template for research presentations](https://github.com/pmichaillat/latex-presentation)

These templates follow typographical best practices and have a minimalist design. You can also [use these LaTeX commands](https://github.com/pmichaillat/latex-math) in conjunction with the templates to obtain mathematical expressions that are more legible and easier to manipulate.

If you are new to LaTeX, feel free [to use Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/edu/ucsantacruz), for which UCSC supplies professional accounts. Overleaf makes it easy to produce research paper and research presentations in LaTeX directly from your web browser. You can use the above templates with Overleaf.

#### Generative artificial intelligence (AI)

In this course, a primary objective is for you to develop the critical thinking, research, and writing skills essential for your academic and professional career. To ensure you are the sole author of your work, the use of generative AI tools—such as ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot, and Claude—for generating any portion of your submitted assignments is strictly prohibited. This includes using AI to brainstorm, create outlines, write drafts, summarize articles, or rephrase text. You are, of course, welcome to use standard tools that check grammar and spelling on text you have already written yourself.

Our goal in this class is to work on our research and writing skills together. We ask that all submitted work is your own original creation from start to finish to make sure you get the most out of every assignment. Relying on AI to generate your text short-circuits this critical practice.
