### Possible ideas for research papers

---

#### Overview

Any research question related to economic slack is acceptable for the research paper. The research question could involve slack directly or related phenomena. The question can look at the US economy, at foreign economies, or at local economies in the US or abroad. The paper can focus on the developed or developing world.

You are welcome to work on any research question that you would like: computational, empirical, or theoretical. If you are looking for some inspiration, I would encourage you to look at the readings for the course. There are several ways to write research papers based on any of the papers assigned as reading:

+ Reproduce the empirical or numerical results of the paper
+ Modify the empirical or numerical results of the paper by using different assumptions or different computational or statistical methods
+ Modify the theoretical result of the paper by using different assumptions
+ Extend the empirical or numerical results of the paper by looking at different variables or outcomes
+ Extend the empirical or numerical results of the paper by using more recent data or data for different countries
+ Extend the theoretical result of the paper by introducing additional elements

#### Some computational ideas

+ Extend the dynamic slackish model to a quantitative model
	+ Introduce firms and separate labor and product markets (Michaillat, Saez 2015)
	+ Introduce inequality to match income and wealth inequality (Saez, Zucman 2020)
	+ Introduce different labor market experiences for different socio-economic groups (Cairo, Cajner 2018)
	+ Introduce banks, maybe with a matching structure (Bencivenga, Camera 2011)
	+ Keep the law of motions of employment and customer base (Gourio, Rudanko 2014)
+ Use the dynamic slackish model for more sophisticated, dynamic policy analysis
+ Use the dynamic slackish model for forecasting
+ Insert the short-run model into a long-run model to have comprehensive model of business cycles and growth (as Garga and Singh 2021 have done for the New Keynesian model)

#### Some empirical ideas

+ Improve the measurement of sufficient statistics for efficient unemployment rate $u^*$ in the US
	+ Elasticity of Beveridge curve (Michaillat, Saez 2021)
	+ Social value of nonwork (Borgschulte, Martorell 2018) 
	+ Recruiting costs (Villena Roldan 2010)
+ Measure the sufficient statistics for efficient unemployment rate $u^*$ in other countries, and apply the formula to other countries (see Gaddnas, Keranen 2023 for Finland)
+ Measure economic slack in developing countries. Most developing countries do not have data on slack, although slack is ubiquitous, so this is a challenging project.
+ Improve the measurement of sufficient statistics for optimal policy, such as the monetary multiplier $du/di$ or the government multiplier $du/dg$.
	+ Alternatively, measure the effects of monetary and fiscal policy on  market tightness

#### Some theoretical ideas

+ Extend the model and policy analysis to an economy with large informal sector, such as India (see Ulyssea 2010, 2018 for Brazil; the model by Albrecht, Navarro, Vroman 2009; or the model by Haanwinckel, Soares 2021)
+ Understand the theoretical reasons behind the large outward shift of the Beveridge curve during the pandemic (see Adams 2023 for an empirical analysis)
+ Adapt the model with long-term relationship and matching to international trade and importer/exporter relationships
