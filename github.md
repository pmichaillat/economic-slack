### Instructions for course submissions via GitHub

---

Each student must create and maintain their own GitHub repository for this course.
This repository will contain all required submissions: presentations of readings, presentation of research, final paper, and code and data.

----

#### One-time setup

1. Create a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup) if you do not already have one. This is completely free. Several GitHub services are also available to students for free, so sign up with your UCSC email address to benefit from those. Please use a professional ID such as `@firstname_lastname`.
2. Watch the [course repository on GitHub](https://github.com/pmichaillat/economic-slack) to be notified when any new material is uploaded, new discussions are started, and new contributions are made to ongoing discussions. To watch the repository, click on the `Notifications` button at the top of the GitHub repository, sign in, and select `All Activity`.
3. Install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) on your computer.
4. Create a new repository in your GitHub account named `econ221_fall2025`.
5. If you wish to keep the repository private, add the instructor (`@pmichaillat`) as a collaborator with read access.
6. Use GitHub Desktop to clone the repository to your computer: `File → Clone Repository`, select your repository, and save it to your computer.

#### Repository structure

Organize your repository as follows:

```
.
├── paper_presentations
│   ├── week1.pdf
│   ├── week4.pdf
│   └── week7.pdf
├── research_presentations
│   ├── outline.pdf
│   ├── earlyresults.pdf
│   └── finalresults.pdf
├── research_paper
│   └── paper.pdf
└── code_data
    └── [your scripts, notebooks, datasets, spreadsheets]
```

+ `/paper_presentations/`: contains your presentations of readings. One PDF per presentation, named according to the week of the presentation.
+ `/research_presentations/`: contains your presentations of research. One PDF per presentation, named according to the research stage.
+ `/research_paper/`: contains your final research paper.
+ `/code_data/`: contains all scripts, notebooks, datasets, spreadsheets, or other code used in your research paper.

#### Submission rules

+ Deadline: all files must be pushed to GitHub before the deadlines.
+ Format: PDF for presentations and paper. Code must run from `/code_data/`.
+ Locations and names: files must be in the specified folders with the specified names.  
+ Grading: only the files in the specified locations with the specified names before the deadline will be graded. Missing or misplaced or misnamed files will be counted as an incomplete.

#### Weekly workflow

1. Place new files in the correct folder with correct filenames on your computer.

   - Write a commit message, such as `Submit first presentation of readings` or `Submit final paper`
   - Click `Commit to main`  
   - Click `Push origin`  
3. Confirm your files appear in your repository on `github.com`.
