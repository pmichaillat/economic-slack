### Instructions for course submissions via GitHub

---

Each student must create and maintain their own GitHub repository for this course.
This repository will contain all required submissions: presentations of readings, presentation of research, final paper, and code and data.

----

#### One-time setup

1. Create a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup) if you do not already have one. This is completely free. Several GitHub services are also available to students for free, so sign up with your UCSC email address to benefit from those. Please use a professional ID such as `firstname_lastname`.
2. Watch the [course portal on GitHub](https://github.com/pmichaillat/economic-slack) to be notified when any new material is uploaded, new discussions are started, and new contributions are made to ongoing discussions. To watch the repository, sign in, click on the `Watch` button at the top of the GitHub repository, and select `All Activity`.
3. Create a new repository in your GitHub account named `econ221_fall2025`.
4. If you wish to keep your repository private, add the instructor (`pmichaillat`) as a collaborator with read access. This can be done by clicking on `Settings → Collaborators → Add people`. Ensure the instructor has read access at all times.
5. Next, to help you manage your GitHub repository, install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) on your computer. With GitHub Desktop you will easily be able to upload local files into your online repository.
6. Use GitHub Desktop to clone the repository to your computer: `File → Clone Repository`, select your repository, and save it to your computer.

#### Repository structure

+ Your course repository should be organized as follows:

```
.

│   ├── week4.pdf
│   └── week7.pdf
├── research_presentations
│   ├── projectoutline.pdf
│   ├── earlyresults.pdf
│   └── finalresults.pdf
├── research_paper
│   └── paper.pdf
└── code_data
    └── [your scripts, notebooks, datasets, spreadsheets]
```

+ `/reading_presentations/` - Folder with your presentations of readings. One PDF per presentation, named according to the week of the presentation.
+ `/research_presentations/` - Folder with your presentations of research. One PDF per presentation, named according to the research stage.
+ `/research_paper/` - Folder with your final research paper.
+ `/code_data/` - Folder with all scripts, notebooks, datasets, spreadsheets, or other code used in your research.
+ You can organize the repository directly on your computer, using the cloned version of the repository.
